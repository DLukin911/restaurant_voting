##Task

Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/Spring-Boot without frontend.

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

* 2 types of users: admin and regular users
* Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
* Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
* Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
* Only one vote counted per user
* If user votes again the same day:
    * If it is before 11:00 we assume that he changed his mind.
    * If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed.

Each restaurant provides a new menu each day.

## Overview

Start your server as a simple Spring-Boot application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or package it then run it as a Java application
```
mvn package
java -jar target/restaurant_voting-{VERSION}.jar
```
